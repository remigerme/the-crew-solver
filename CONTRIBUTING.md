# Contributing

The project consists in two distinct components:

1. a Rust solver
2. a website acting as a front end to interact with the solver.

We are actively looking for contributors to [implement tasks](src/task/README.md).

## Rust solver

The general overview of what need to be done is as follows:

1. create a roadmap of all tasks of The Crew
2. implement all these tasks.

[Learn more on task implementation.](src/task/README.md)

## Web front end

Not in active development for now. Feel free to start a draft on your own (don't forget [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)).

The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to use the solver. Under the hood, the solver will be integrated using web assembly.

The website will then be deployed using github pages.
