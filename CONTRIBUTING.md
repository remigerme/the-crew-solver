# Contributing

The project consists in two distinct components:

1. a Rust solver
2. a website acting as a front end to interact with the solver.

I am actively looking for contributors to develop the web frontend.

## Rust solver

The Rust solver is now complete! Minor modifications can still be made to the solver if needed, but nothing big is expected.

## Web frontend

I want to start developing this part although I am not a web developer. Feel free to start a draft on your own (don't forget [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)).

The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to use the solver. Under the hood, the solver will be integrated using web assembly.

The website will then be deployed using github pages.

Thank you for your interest in the project!
